# Digiweather 👾☀️

This project borns with the pure intention of practice and code using APIs and my lovely Python, based on what I've been learning recently. The primary goal is to create a weather map, but instead of clouds, suns and so, you'll see... Digimons! Also you'll be able to know what's the Digimon of the day/week/month, the one of your birthday... It's going to be pretty awesome.
