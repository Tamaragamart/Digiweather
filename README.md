# Digiweather üëæ‚òÄÔ∏è

This project borns with the pure intention of practice and code using APIs and my lovely Python, based on what I've been learning recently. The primary goal is to create a weather map, but instead of clouds, suns and so, you'll see... Digimons! Also you'll be able to know what's the Digimon of the day/week/month, the one of your birthday... It's going to be pretty awesome.

## Project Phases:
### Phase 1: AEMET and Digimon APIs
In this phase, scripts and necessary code will be developed to fetch data from the AEMET and various Digimon APIs. Separate functions or modules will be created to interact with each API, and the obtained data will be stored in an appropriate format for subsequent use.

### Phase 2: Data Integration Backend
The aim of this phase is to build a backend that integrates data obtained from the AEMET and Digimon APIs. The necessary logic will be developed to combine and organize this data coherently. This phase may include creating API endpoints to access the combined data.

### Phase 3: Frontend - Webpage Creation
In this final phase, the web application's frontend will be constructed. The user interface will display meteorological data obtained from AEMET and Digimon information. Users will be able to interact with the map, select dates, visualize Digimon-related information, among other functionalities.

## Repository Structure:
The repository is organized as follows:

/phase1: Contains code corresponding to Phase 1.
/phase2: Includes backend code for data integration.
/phase3: This directory houses the frontend code of the web application.
